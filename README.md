# BMG 

## Description
This is a very basic REST API made in Java with Spring Boot. There is no front-end so everything is tested in Postman. 
For this program I used NoSQL MongoDB database to store informaion.

## Functionality 
Users can register and rent books. In the future I will also add buying feature so each book will have it's price.
