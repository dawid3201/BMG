# BMG 

## Description
This is a very basic REST API made in Java with Spring Boot. There is no front-end implemented yet so everything is tested in Postman. 
For this program I used MySQL database to store informaion.

## Functionality 
Users can register and rent books. In the future I will add more and more features.
Users have roles such as "USER" and "ADMIN". Admins can add new books, users can rent them. 

## Database 
An example of User objectc stored on databas.
